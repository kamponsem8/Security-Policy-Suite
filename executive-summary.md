# Clay & Craft Renovations

## Executive Summary

This document presents three critical Information Technology policies for Clay & Craft Renovationsâ€™ Employee Handbook: the Acceptable Use Policy for Information Technology, Work From Home Policy, and Digital Media Sanitization, Reuse, & Destruction Policy. As an internationally recognized firm specializing in smart home technology integration while preserving architectural integrity, Clay & Craft Renovations must maintain robust IT governance to protect both company and client information assets.
Our operations across Delaware, Maryland, and Pennsylvania require these comprehensive policies to address emerging cybersecurity threats, ensure regulatory compliance, and protect the proprietary design techniques and client data that form the foundation of our competitive advantage. The integration of IoT technologies into historical renovations creates unique security challenges that these policies directly address.
Each policy outlines specific employee responsibilities, compliance requirements, and enforcement mechanisms:

1.	The Acceptable Use Policy establishes clear guidelines for proper use of company technology resources to maintain information confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

2.	The Work From Home Policy establishes mandatory security protocols and day-to-day guidelines that all remote employees must follow to ensure continued protection of sensitive information outside our facilities.

3.	The Digital Media Sanitization, Reuse, & Destruction Policy establishes procedures for properly handling electronic storage devices throughout their lifecycle to prevent unauthorized disclosure of information.

These policies are mandatory for all Clay & Craft Renovations employees and contractors. Compliance is essential to protect our reputation for excellence while safeguarding our digital assets and those of our clients.
